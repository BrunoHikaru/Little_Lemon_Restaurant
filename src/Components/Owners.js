        <h1>Little Lemon</h1>
        <h2>Chicago</h2>
        <p> Nestled in the heart of the neighborhood, Little Lemon is more than just a bistroâ€”it's a vibrant gathering place where good food, great drinks,
             and genuine hospitality come together. Founded by lifelong friends Mario and Adrian, the restaurant was born from a shared passion for simple,
              honest cooking and a desire to create a space that feels like home.</p>
            <p>At Little Lemon, we celebrate the beauty of locally-sourced ingredients, crafting a menu that changes with the seasons and features inspired daily specials.
                 From comforting classics to bold Mediterranean flavors, every dish is made with care and served in a lively yet relaxed setting that invites conversation,
                  connection, and community.</p>
